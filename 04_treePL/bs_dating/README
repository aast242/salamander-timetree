Dating using treePL was done in two chunks for the bootstrapped trees, mainly due to time constraints with submitting revisions. In the first round, 173 of the bootstraps were dated. In the second round, the other 27 bootstraps were dated (using the same parameters), and concatenated into the other 173. That final concatenated file is the all200_BS_dated.tre file in this directory.
